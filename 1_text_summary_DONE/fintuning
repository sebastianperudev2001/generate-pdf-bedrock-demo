{"prompt": "This is a on-site log report of turbine breakdown. Issue Log Date – 25-12-2023, Model Number – TB-CL-7882, Issue - Cracks appeared in the part MR 7882-9571 next to the rotor hub. The nut connecting the rotor blade to the rotor hub seems to be damaged. The Anemometer readings seem to be within range. The electric braking seems to be unused. No indication of damage to any other component of the turbine except normal wear and tear. Potential Root Cause – Seems due to reduced tensile strength of the nut connecting the blade to the rotor. Last Maintenance Date – 12-12-2023, Last Maintenance Issues Recorded - No known issues recorded and all the parameters were within range.Summarize the text in 2 lines.","completion": "Model No-TB-CL-7882, Issue - The nut connecting the rotor blade to the rotor hub seems to be damaged, Potential Root Cause – Seems due to reduced tensile strength of the nut connecting the blade to the rotor. No known issues recorded in last maintenance."}
